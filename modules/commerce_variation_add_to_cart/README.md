##INTRODUCTION

If you want to have a separate add to cart button for each product variation,
then this module is for you. Beside showing buttons for each variation, there
are additional settings, like option to display or not price, currency and
quantity. You can also choose which product attributes to show in your add to
cart form.

To use this module you must have Drupal Commerce 2.x installed. This module was
created for one of our projects, and it is still in a development phase, just

feature please open an issue.
